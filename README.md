Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
This notebook about predicting whether the patient has heart disease or not according to their medical attributes

More specifically, we'll look at the following topics.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.
Model training - create model(s) to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.
Model evaluation - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics.
Model comparison - comparing several different models to find the best one.
Model fine-tuning - once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?
Feature importance - since we're predicting the presence of heart disease, are there some things which are more important for prediction?
Cross-validation - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data
